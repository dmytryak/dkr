Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big fat tires
And everything
I love it and I need it
I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star

Okay, but here's another one I could screw up
What is it?
Am I gonna do this by myself?
Yeah, he should do it by himself
Do it by yourself
Okay, well
I think I'll try it in a different key, I'll try it in a normal key
Yeah
If it sounds bad, these people are just gonna have to wait
Do you have a smoke?
Okay
